## Getting Started

To get started with these practice programs, clone the repository to your local machine and follow the instructions provided for each program.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Any code editor
- You have a basic understanding of programming concepts

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/NoelSaludo/PracticeProgramCS.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd PracticeProgramCS
    ```

## Usage

Each folder in this repository contains a different practice program. Follow the instructions in the respective folder's README file to write the program.
### Available Programs to practice

#### Easy
- **Calculator**: Create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- [ToDoApp](ToDoApp/README.md): Write a simple ToDo app that can record tasks while using basic OOP principle
- **Simple Banking System**: Implement a basic banking system where users can create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance.
- **Basic File I/O**: Write a program that reads from a file and writes to a file. For example, read a list of names from a file and write them to another file in reverse order.
- **Tic-Tac-Toe**: Create a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played between two players.

These projects will help beginner programmers and freshman computer science majors practice basic procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming concepts.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to provide beginner programmers and freshman computer science majors with a variety of practice programs that they can use to improve their coding skills.
By working through these projects, users will gain hands-on experience with basic programming concepts and skills.
The project encourages users to write their own code, allowing them the freedom to take their time and develop a deeper understanding of how basic programming works.
This approach aims to build a strong foundation in programming principles and problem-solving techniques.
